The initial workings of a replacement board for the soda vending machine in the ACM office at UIUC. This is the microcontroller software component.

This project was undertaken as a semester-long lab project, but the initial scope was too broad. Instead, the project ended up accomplishing serial UART communication to control an array of several 2-line displays. This fragment of the initial scope would provide a way for the host computer to display soda selections and availability next to the indiviual buttons on the soda machine, without the need for an external display (monitor).

Developed for the Keil RTX real-time operating system.
